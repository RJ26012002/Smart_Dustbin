# Smart_Dustbin
## About
This project is to design and build a prototype for an
automatic open dustbin that can automatically open the lid
when it detects the people who want to throw out their
trash. 
So this can be done by implementing IoT based waste
management using smart dustbin.

## Work Description
The automation of the smart dustbin is achieved through the use of a simple Arduino
*Uno microcontroller*. It is an affordable piece of equipment which can be bought online
for a price of INR 400 on almost all major online retailers like Amazon, Flipkart etc.
However to accomplish this project we have also used some basic electrical components in
addition to the microcontroller.These include a 
# Breadboard ,Potentiometer, Servo motor, an ultrasonic sensor, an LCDdisplay, a suitable power supply and of course a lot of connecting wires.
All of these components can be made to interact with each other using the Arduino Uno
Microcontroller with the help of a program called Arduino IDE.
Arduino IDE is a development environment created by the company that manufactures
Arduino microcontrollers.
It is based on C programming language and its syntax is easy and intuitive to learn. The Code for this project to work is provided in this repository.
